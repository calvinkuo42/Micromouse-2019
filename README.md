# Micromouse-2019

IEEE Micromouse project I did with Philip Kwan and Sean Chen at UCLA over the 2018-19 school year. We began with a STM32 Nucleo Development board and assembled a demo from a previously designed kit. We then programmed the hardware using C on mbed. A similar code was used to control the "mouse" we later designed ourselves (schematic and board).
